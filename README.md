Java-Toolkit
============

This is to become a simple toolkit GUI that allows for loading of configuration files. The configuration files will contain the strings and actions used in the toolkit.

Things you will be able to run with configuration files:

 - Commands
 - Java Functions
 - Remote Commands (SSH, if somebody else can work on this part, that would be great)
